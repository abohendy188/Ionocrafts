\section*{Simulating the model using Comsol}
\hspace{\parindent} Simulating the model using the Corona discharge previously defined package in Comsol was somehow a challenging task, but we could get some results as we did the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Studying the plasma module (the module specified to simulate corona discharge)
    \item Defining the constants and parameters usually used in the simulation
    \item Setting all the required chemical reactions, including:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Electron impact reactions
                \item Surface reactions
                
            \end{enumerate}
    \item Setting the initial values 
    \item Setting the boundary conditions 
    \item Adjusting the meshing to solve by finite volume method (which is preferable for the software)
    \item Adjusting time dependency to take results in different instants
    
\end{enumerate}
\hspace{\parindent}After all of this, we could get results, but what was disappointing is that we couldn't get results except for the 1D model, as the other 2D and 3D models have failed due to both technical and informatics problems.
\hspace{\parindent}From these results, we could calculate the current density at the applied voltage we did in the hardware and got to compare them in the analysis section.
