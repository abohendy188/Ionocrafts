\section*{Simulating the model using CST}
\hspace{\parindent}This method is being mentioned just to record the numerous tries we made to use this software (CST), but all of it came to a bad end.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We started to draw the unit of the lifter wire and the aluminum foil
    \item We canâ€™t set voltage to a non-PEC martial 
    \item We set both the wire and aluminum foil into PEC and imagine it as an approximation 
    \item We take the steps into initializing the system and boundary conditions.
    \item due to limited knowledge and time when simulating no results output because of an error that connects the two PEC
\end{enumerate}
